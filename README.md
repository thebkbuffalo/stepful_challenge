code challenge for Stepful

Welcome to my code challenge. 

To get started:

USING RUBY 3.2.2 and RAILS 7.1.0

- Clone down the repo
- run `rails db:create` to create the databases.
- run `rails db:migrate` to run migrations.
- run `rails db:seed` to seed the database.
- (or `rails db:setup` would work as well)

- `bundle install`

- start a ralis server with `rails s`
